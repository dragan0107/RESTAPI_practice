# RESTAPI_practice
RESTAPI practice made with node, express and mongoose, refactored version.

Currently, I have started rebuilding this project yet again, hence I'm updating this Readme.

The goal for this RESTful API is to implement FULL functionality with registering, logging in, protected routes with specific roles, error handling and much more.
I want to practice and use all the knowledge I've acquired until now in NodeJS, Express, Mongoose.
